# Dua Abu Hamza Thumali

## Introduction

Dua Abu Hamza Thumali is a profound and intimate supplication (munajat) taught by Imam Ali ibn Husayn Zainul Abideen (peace be upon him), the fourth Imam of the Ahlul Bayt. This beautiful and moving dua is also known as the "Whispered Prayer of Abu Hamza Al-Thumali" and is particularly recommended during the pre-dawn hours of the holy month of Ramadan. 

This supplication represents one of the finest examples of intimate conversation with Allah, expressing deep love, hope, and spiritual longing. It teaches the etiquette of prayer and demonstrates how a believer should approach their Creator with both reverence and loving familiarity.

## Historical Background and Significance

The dua is named after Abu Hamza Al-Thumali, a trusted companion of Imam Zainul Abideen (peace be upon him), who narrated this supplication from the Imam. Abu Hamza was a distinguished scholar and narrator of hadith from Kufa, who served four Imams: Imam Zainul Abideen, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq, and Imam Musa al-Kadhim (peace be upon them all).

Imam Zainul Abideen would recite this dua during the pre-dawn hours (sahar) in the month of Ramadan. He was known for his devotion to worship and his collection of supplications, compiled in the famous book "Al-Sahifa Al-Sajjadiyya" (The Psalms of Islam). Dua Abu Hamza Thumali, though not part of the Sahifa, is one of his most cherished and widely recited supplications.

The significance of this dua lies in its profound spiritual insights and its capacity to:
- Establish a deep connection with Allah through heartfelt conversation
- Express humility and recognition of one's spiritual poverty before Allah
- Balance fear of Allah's justice with hope in His mercy
- Articulate the believer's longing for divine proximity and acceptance

It has been recommended by scholars throughout Islamic history for its transformative spiritual effects and its eloquent expression of the soul's yearning for its Creator.

## Arabic Text

اللَّهُمَّ لا تُؤَدِّبْنِي بِعُقُوبَتِكَ، وَلا تَمْكُرْ بِي فِي حِيلَتِكَ، مِنْ أَيْنَ لِيَ الْخَيْرُ يَا رَبِّ وَلا يُوجَدُ إِلاَّ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ، وَمِنْ أَيْنَ لِيَ النَّجَاةُ وَلا تُسْتَطَاعُ إِلاَّ بِكَ، لا الَّذِي أَحْسَنَ اسْتَغْنى عَنْ عَوْنِكَ وَرَحْمَتِكَ، وَلا الَّذِي أَسَاءَ وَاجْتَرَأَ عَلَيْكَ وَلَمْ يُرْضِكَ خَرَجَ عَنْ قُدْرَتِكَ

يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ بِكَ عَرَفْتُكَ، وَأَنْتَ دَلَلْتَنِي عَلَيْكَ، وَدَعَوْتَنِي إِلَيْكَ، وَلَوْلا أَنْتَ لَمْ أَدْرِ مَا أَنْتَ، الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي أَدْعُوهُ فَيُجِيبُنِي، وَإِنْ كُنْتُ بَطِيئاً حِينَ يَدْعُونِي، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي أَسْأَلُهُ فَيُعْطِينِي، وَإِنْ كُنْتُ بَخِيلاً حِينَ يَسْتَقْرِضُنِي

وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي أُنَادِيهِ كُلَّمَا شِئْتُ لِحَاجَتِي، وَأَخْلُو بِهِ حَيْثُ شِئْتُ لِسِرِّي بِغَيْرِ شَفِيع، فَيَقْضِي لِي حَاجَتِي، الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي لا أَدْعُو غَيْرَهُ، وَلَوْ دَعَوْتُ غَيْرَهُ لَمْ يَسْتَجِبْ لِي دُعَائِي، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي لا أَرْجُو غَيْرَهُ، وَلَوْ رَجَوْتُ غَيْرَهُ لأَخْلَفَ رَجَائِي

وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي وَكَلَنِي إِلَيْهِ فَأَكْرَمَنِي، وَلَمْ يَكِلْنِي إِلَى النَّاسِ فَيُهِينُونِي، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي تَحَبَّبَ إِلَيَّ وَهُوَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِّي، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي يَحْلُمُ عَنِّي حَتَّى كَأَنِّي لا ذَنْبَ لِي، فَرَبِّي أَحْمَدُ شَيْء عِنْدِي، وَأَحَقُّ بِحَمْدِي

اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَجِدُ سُبُلَ الْمَطَالِبِ إِلَيْكَ مُشْرَعَةً، وَمَنَاهِلَ الرَّجَاءِ لَدَيْكَ مُتْرَعَةً، وَالإسْتِعَانَةَ بِفَضْلِكَ لِمَنْ أَمَّلَكَ مُبَاحَةً، وَأَبْوَابَ الدُّعَاءِ إِلَيْكَ لِلصَّارِخِينَ مَفْتُوحَةً، وَأَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ لِلرَّاجِي بِمَوْضِعِ إِجَابَة، وَلِلْمَلْهُوفِينَ بِمَرْصَدِ إِغَاثَة

## English Translation

O Allah! Do not discipline me by Your punishment, and do not plot against me in Your stratagem. From where shall I obtain the good, O Lord, and none can provide it but You? And from where shall I obtain salvation, and none can grant it but You? He who does good deeds is not in need of Your help and mercy, and he who does evil and disobeys You (and then repents), has not escaped from Your power.

O Lord! O Lord! Through You I have known You. You showed me the way to Yourself and invited me to You. Had it not been for You, I would not have known who You are. All praise belongs to Allah whom I call upon and He answers me, even though I am slow when He calls upon me. All praise belongs to Allah whom I ask and He gives me, even though I am miserly when He asks me for a loan.

All praise belongs to Allah whom I call whenever I wish for my needs, and I confide in Him privately for my secrets without an intercessor, and He fulfills my need. All praise belongs to Allah besides whom I do not call upon anyone, and if I were to call upon others, they would not answer my call. All praise belongs to Allah besides whom I place no hope in anyone, and if I placed my hope in others, they would disappoint my hope.

All praise belongs to Allah who entrusted me to Himself and thus honored me, and did not entrust me to people who would humiliate me. All praise belongs to Allah who endeared Himself to me while He is in no need of me. All praise belongs to Allah who treats me with clemency as though I have no sin. My Lord is the most praiseworthy entity to me, and most deserving of my praise.

O Allah! I find the roads of requests to You wide open, the springs of hope from You abundantly flowing, the doors of supplication to You open for those who cry out to You, and I know that You are in a position to answer for those who hope in You, in a place of respite for those who are distressed...
