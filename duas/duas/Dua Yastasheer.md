بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ

اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْٓ اَسْئَلُكَ بِاِسْمِكَ الَّذِيْ بِهٖ يَسْتَشِيْرُ عَبْدُكَ مِنْ عَذَابِكَ عِنْدَ حُلُوْلِهٖ وَ يَسْتَغِيْثُ بِهٖ الْهَارِبُ مِنْ عِقَابِكَ عِنْدَ اِشْرَافِهٖ عَلَيْهِ وَ يَفْزَعُ اِلَيْهِ الْمُذْنِبُ مِنَ الْعِقَابِ عِنْدَ حُدُوْثِهٖ الَّذِيْ تَوَضَعَتْ لَهُ كُلُّ الْخَلَائِقِ وَ خَضَعَتْ لَهُ الرِّقَابُ وَ خَشَعَتْ لَهُ الْاَصْوَاتُ وَ وَجِلَتْ لَهُ الْقُلُوْبُ مِنْ مَخَافَتِكَ وَ ارْتَعَدَتْ لَهُ الْاَقْدَامُ مِنْ هَيْبَتِكَ

اَسْئَلُكَ يَا رَبِّ بِحَقِّ عَلِيٍّ أمير المُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَ وَصِيِّ رَسُوْلِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ وَ زَوْجِ فَاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِسَآءِ الْعَالَمِيْنَ وَ حَقِّ الْحَسَنِ وَ الْحُسَيْنِ السِّبْطَيْنِ سَيِّدَيْ شَبَابِ اَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ اَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَنْ تَفْعَلَ بِيْ كَذَا وَ كَذَا...

اَللّهُمَّ اِنِّيْٓ اَسْئَلُكَ بِاِسْمِكَ الَّذِي خَضَعَتْ لَهُ الرِّقَابُ وَ ذَلَّتْ لَهُ الصِّعَابُ وَ سَهُلَتْ لَهُ الشِّدَادُ وَ قَامَتْ بِهٖ السَّمٰوَاتُ وَ الْاَرْضُ وَ اسْتَقَرَّتْ بِهٖ الْجِبَالُ وَ جَرَتْ بِهٖ الْمِيَاهُ وَ اُنْزِلَتْ بِهٖ الْكُتُبُ وَ اُرْسِلَتْ بِهٖ الرُّسُلُ

وَ اَسْئَلُكَ بِحَقِّ مُحَمَّدٍ الْمُصْطَفٰى وَ عَلِيٍّ الْمُرْتَضٰى وَ فَاطِمَةَ الزَّهْرَآءِ وَ الْحَسَنِ الْمُجْتَبٰى وَ الْحُسَيْنِ الشَّهِيْدِ بِكَرْبَلَاءَ وَ بِحَقِّ الْاَئِمَّةِ التِّسْعَةِ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّةِ الْحُسَيْنِ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّلَامُ اَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اَنْ تَقْضِيَ حَوَائِجِيْ وَ تُفَرِّجَ عَنِّيْ هَمِّيْ وَ غَمِّيْ

## English Translation

In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful

O Allah! I ask You by Your Name by which Your servant seeks protection from Your punishment at its arrival, and by which the one fleeing seeks refuge from Your retribution when it approaches, and by which the sinner seeks shelter from punishment at its occurrence. The Name before which all creation humbles itself, necks submit, voices become hushed, hearts tremble in Your fear, and feet quiver in awe of Your majesty.

I ask You, O Lord, by the right of Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, the successor of the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds, the husband of Fatima, the leader of the women of the worlds, and by the right of Hasan and Husayn, the two grandsons, the leaders of the youth of Paradise, that You send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and that You do for me such and such... [mention your needs]

O Allah! I ask You by Your Name before which necks submit, difficulties become easy, hardships are simplified, by which the heavens and earth are established, mountains stand firm, waters flow, books are revealed, and messengers are sent.

And I ask You by the right of Muhammad the Chosen One, Ali the Pleased One, Fatima the Radiant, Hasan the Selected, Husayn the Martyr of Karbala, and by the right of the nine Imams from the descendants of Husayn, peace be upon them all, that You send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, that You fulfill my needs, and remove from me my worries and sorrows.
